Buggy Bug,"The sun burns out 175,000,000 tons of hydrogen in 0.25 sec. It has been doing that since billions of years and it will continue doing so for billions more. Andromeda is inching closer to us by 27 Km every 1/4th sec and still it will take billions of more years to collide. It&#39;s true that none of us who are watching this nor our upcoming billion-th generation will be around when the sun will run out of hydrogen or Andromeda will be at visible distance of collision but thinking about it made me 😥😥 and 😱🥶.

Sam,"The average amount someone blinks a day is from 14,400 to 19,200. I’m going to go off of 19,200. 19,200 times 15,000 is 288,000,000. 288,000,000 stars are born every day. Let’s do this again but with a week. You will blink about 134,400 a week. That times 15,000 is 2,016,000,000. Now a year (52 weeks) is about 4,200,000 blinks. Times that with 15,000 and you get 63,000,000,000. Go back to the beginning. 19,200 blinks a day and you will stop and think about it and only think about it maybe 20 blinks until you forget about it and move on with your life.

Johnny Deep,"My quick BOE calculations show about 31 supernovas per second:<br /><br />100 billion galaxies in the observable universe<br />1 supernova per 100 years per galaxy<br />= 1 billion supernovas per year = 31.7 per second.<br /><br />Checking your source estimates, and using 2 trillion galaxies and 2 supernovas per 100 years per galaxy, we multiply that 40 to get about 1200 SNs per second, or 300 per .25 sec eye blink!   Well, what do you know.  Impressive either way.<br /><br />EDIT: I now think that 2 SNs per 100 years per galaxy is too high, since 80% of galaxies are dwarfs that would not have such a high rate.",2021-02-13T18:49:09Z,0,0

Jake Stewart,"I know this doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the video, but I would like to share these questions and this message with as many people as possible.<br /> <br />1. What do you think happens to someone after they die?<br />2. Do you think there is an afterlife? <br />3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? <br />4. Do you think you are good enough to get into heaven?<br /> <br />No one is good enough to get into heaven. Here are a few questions to test your goodness: <br /> <br />1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? <br />2. Have you ever stolen? <br />3. Have you ever used God&#39;s name in vain?<br />4. Jesus said that &quot;whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&quot; (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? <br />5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? <br />6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?<br /> <br />The Bible says that &quot;all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone&quot; (Revelation 21:8) and &quot;Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people — none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn&#39;t have to go to Hell? <br /> <br />2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God&#39;s law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus’ death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. <br /> <br />What you have to do is repent, or turn toward God, and believe in Jesus Christ. Don&#39;t trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, “No one is good — except God alone” (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. <br /> <br />When are you going to do that?<br /> <br />Here is a short Christian movie on this subject and depression: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc</a>",2021-02-12T12:02:52Z,1,0
Jean Thomas,"I wonder what you exactly mean with &quot;will be born&quot; or &quot;will form&quot;, cuz the evolution from nothing to a star or a planet takes ages, and there&#39;s not really a &quot;practically formed&quot; star or planet. You can&#39;t make the difference between a finished planet and a planet that&#39;s a-blink-of-an-eye-close to being finished.

This means that we need to take the extremely short time each of us individually has and enjoy every blink we will ever get. Ever take anything for granted. Why should we. Life gave us the ability to observe and wonder for a short moment. To be happy and sad, to experience and cherish, to love and hate. We only get one chance. So don’t think of this fact as a downside. Think of it as a gift. We get to live.",2021-02-11T06:03:08Z,8,0

Nicolas Vogelius,Thats the reason why dead people are in another world (like pardise for ex)<br />Explanation: dead people cant blink but alive people still blink. Since alive people can see things like supernovaes and black holes that means blinking=alive universe with life and death.<br />While with dead people... no blinking=nothing happens<br />Everything is already dead so nothing is dying and only the dead enter this world so born things couldnt be there too<br />Imagine a parallel universe for the dead where no stars exist. But only death (this could mean 2 things: either the universe is empty or there are the remaining stages of things ex: small stars would make in the &quot;dead universe&quot; only black dwarves),2021-02-09T21:57:31Z,0,0

TahirRaj1337,"Every 0.25 seconds this much happens in space as we know it. Thats far more beyond our imagination. This and everything we&#39;ve seen till now, is an evidence that proves universe is infinitely huge. That you still cannot see that much chaos in the night sky, after u have blinked. It proves that everything is so distant and far from each object. That we only see the stars, that are just as young and habitable for life as our sun. And those stars we see in the night sky, is just small DOT of our Galaxy. Mind blowing!!🙏🙏🙏",2021-02-09T18:07:03Z,0,0

Johnny Quest,Bro I&#39;ve watched you since... &quot;If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch.&quot;  I&#39;ve always been interested and do my fair share of research for my own knowledge of the cosmos. I must say the videos you construct allow people who don&#39;t dive into the story of the universe to understand and convey to others our cosmic identity as well as develope an interest. They are the best videos I&#39;ve seen in some time.   You must find private funding and a team of your choice to pursue this path that you&#39;re on.  Your more recent videos leave my mind excited and complacent of my position in the cosmos. Fulfilled and longing for who or what&#39;s waiting to be discovered.   <br /><br />Thanks.,2021-02-09T17:59:45Z,0,0
